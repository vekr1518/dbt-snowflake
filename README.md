Welcome to the new dbt project!

# dbt_snowflake_project

# Introduction
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the DBT (Data Build Tool). The first project in the series will cover the fundamental aspects of DBT, including the need for the tool and where it fits in the ETL process. To demonstrate how DBT can be used in real-life scenarios, we will be using Netflix movies and series data stored in Snowflake. By using DBT with Snowflake, we will show how businesses can leverage these tools to solve complex data problems. Through this project, we will gain insight into the various features of DBT and how they can be used to build robust data pipelines.
